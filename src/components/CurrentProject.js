        After building out 'DonorPool,' my first app using Redux, I took some
        time to build out a portfolio page, which you're on now. Hi! I've also
        been reworking my resume and going back to make a few of my older
        projects a bit more friendly code-wise. Next up, I'll be looking into
        setting up servers for my web apps, rather than hosting them on Heroku
        or AWS.
