      Full stack web developer with a flair for the theatrical and a mission to leave the world a better place than I got it. Experienced in Javascript programming including React and Redux, as well as Ruby on Rails. I discovered web development while customizing a professional website for myself, and got hooked on the problem solving and creativity of programming. After graduating Flatiron School, I was hired on as a Technical Coaching Fellow to help teach new students, write curriculum, and further my knowledge of the subjects we teach.
