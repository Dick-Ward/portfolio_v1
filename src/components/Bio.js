      Full stack web developer with a flair for the theatrical and a mission to
      leave the world a better place than I got it. Experienced in Rails and
      Javascript programming including React and Redux. I discovered web
      development while customizing a professional website for myself, and got
      hooked on the problem solving and creativity of programming. My background
      in improvisation helps me to bring a team-based work ethic to anything I
      do.
